Intent = Flexible workflow platform (extensibility-first)
Market = Different buyers, not zero-sum

DEFENSIBLE MOATS (Copy-Proof)

   - 4-layer analyzer (linguistic, contributor, quality, LLM)
   - Saves 20% review time
   - Time to copy: 6+ months
   - Win rate: 85% when mentioned

2. APPROVAL GATING (SHA256 Binding)
   - Cryptographic signatures on approvals
   - Full forensic audit trail
   - Required for SOC 2/HIPAA
   - Win rate: 95% in enterprise

3. MULTI-MODEL ROUTING
   - Complexity-aware model selection
   - 30% cost savings
   - Time to copy: Medium (requires calibration data)
   - Win rate: 80% when discussed

GAP ANALYSIS
------------
What Intent Has | What We Need | Timeline
BYOA Framework  | BYOA (Q3)    | 2 sprints
Living Spec     | Adaptive specs (Q3) | 3 sprints

CUSTOMER SEGMENTS & WIN RATES
-----------------------------
Enterprise (>200 eng)        75% | Need approval gating ✓
Mid-Market (50-200 eng)      50% | Balanced, competitive
Startups (<50 eng)           65% | Cost + speed ✓
Agencies (multi-client)      20% | pre-Q3 | 60% post-Q3

Our TAM: $1.2B | Intent TAM: $0.4B | Total Market: $1.55B

ROADMAP PRIORITIES (Impact Order)
----------------------------------
Q1 NOW      | Slop detection + approval gating (LIVE) [MOAT LOCKED]
Q2 2026     | MCP Server (IDE integration) [STICKINESS]
Q3 2026     | BYOA + Living Spec (CLOSE THE GAP)
Q4 2026     | Workspace consolidation (UX POLISH)

AFTER Q3: We're objectively better (their flexibility + our moats + our cost)

SALES CONVERSATION STARTERS
---------------------------
Enterprise: "Tell me about your audit requirements. Approval gating?"
Agencies:   "How many clients? Different workflows for each?"
Startups:   "How many PRs/month? What's your AI cost?"
Everyone:   "Ever get slop PRs from AI automation?"

OBJECTION HANDLERS (Memorize These)
-----------------------------------
"Intent has BYOA"
→ "We're shipping Q3. But do you have AI slop? Approval gating? We win there."

"Intent seems simpler"
→ "Until you scale. At 500 PRs/day, you need all three: cost, governance, quality."

"We already have GitHub review"
→ "GitHub is feedback. We're cryptographic attestation. Different tools."

"How do we know slop works?"
→ "One-week pilot, no commitment. You'll see the value immediately."
