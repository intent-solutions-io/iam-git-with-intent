## Beads Log (Internal)

```bash
# Examples (Linux):
bd epic create "phase-<n>: <short>" --repo <repo-name>
bd task create --epic <bd-epic-id> "phase-<n>.<m>: <task>"
bd ls
bd show <bd-epic-id>
bd status <bd-task-id> completed
```

**Commands run this phase:**
- `bd epic create "phase-[N]: [title]" --repo [repo]` → `<epic-id>`
- `bd task create --epic <epic-id> "[N].1: [task]"` → `<task-id-1>`
- `bd status <task-id-1> completed`

---

## AgentFS Notes (Internal)

```bash
# Record what agentfs mount/db is in use for this repo/session (examples):
ls -la .agentfs || true
# If your workflow uses a known db path, record it in metadata and artifacts.
```

**Session info:**
- Agent ID: `<agent-id>`
- Mount path: `<mount-path>`
- DB path: `<db-path>`
