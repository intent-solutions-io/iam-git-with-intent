# Governance

## Current Model

Git With Intent is **maintainer-led** by Intent Solutions LLC.

### Maintainers

- Jeremy Longshore (@jeremylongshore) - Project lead

### Decision Making

- Technical decisions: via GitHub Issues and PRs
- Architecture changes: require maintainer approval
- Breaking changes: require RFC in Discussions first

### Release Authority

- Maintainers approve and publish releases
- Semantic versioning: major.minor.patch
- All releases tagged and documented in CHANGELOG.md

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to propose changes.

## Future

As the project grows, we may establish:

- Working groups for specific areas (agents, infrastructure, SDK)
- Formal RFC process for major changes
- Community maintainer roles

For now, open an issue or discussion to propose governance changes.
