================================================================================
THE STRATEGY IN 10 BULLETS
================================================================================

1. WE COMPETE ON SAFETY, NOT FLEXIBILITY
   - GWI: production-grade (quality, governance, cost)
   - Intent: productivity tool (extensibility)
   - Different buyers, not zero-sum

2. THREE DEFENSIBLE MOATS
   A. AI Slop Detection (6+ months to copy)
      - Only solution to junk PR problem
      - Saves 20% review time
      - Win rate: 85%

   B. Approval Gating with SHA256 (3-4 months to copy)
      - Cryptographic signatures, full audit trail
      - Required for SOC 2/HIPAA
      - Win rate: 95% in enterprise

   C. Multi-Model Routing (30% cost savings)
      - Complexity-aware model selection
      - Win rate: 80% when cost matters

3. MARKET SEGMENTATION
   Enterprise (>200 eng) ......... 75% GWI (moat: approval gating)
   Mid-Market (50-200 eng) ....... 50% GWI (competitive)
   Startups (<50 eng) ............ 65% GWI (moat: cost + slop)
   Agencies (multi-client) ....... 20% GWI now → 60% after Q3

   Total TAM: $1.55B | Our TAM: $1.21B | Win %: 60%

4. ROADMAP: CLOSE THE GAP
   Q1 (NOW)   → Slop detection + approval gating (LIVE)
   Q2         → MCP Server (IDE integration)
   Q3 (BIG)   → BYOA + Living Spec (answer Intent's strength)
   Q4         → Workspace consolidation

   After Q3: We have THEIR flexibility + OUR moats + CHEAPER cost. Better.

5. SALES STRATEGY BY PAIN POINT
   Problem: Drowning in AI bot PRs
   → Lead: Slop Detection | Win %: 85% | Deal: $500-2K/mo

   Problem: Need audit-ready approvals
   → Lead: Approval Gating | Win %: 95% | Deal: $50K-500K/yr

   Problem: AI costs exploding
   → Lead: Cost Routing | Win %: 80% | Deal: $10K-30K/mo

   Problem: Each client needs different workflow
   → Lead: BYOA (Q3 launch) | Win %: 60-70% post-Q3 | Deal: $5K-15K/mo

6. OBJECTION HANDLERS (Memorize These)
   "Intent has BYOA"
   → "We ship Q3. But do you have slop problem? Approval gating?"

   "Intent seems simpler"
   → "Until you scale. At 500 PRs/day, cost+governance+quality all matter."

   "We already have GitHub review"
   → "GitHub is feedback. We're cryptographic attestation + quality detection."

   "How do we know slop works?"
   → "One-week pilot. You'll see the value immediately."

7. PRICING MODEL
   Freemium:   Free (50 PRs/month)
   Pro:        $500/month (unlimited)
   Enterprise: Custom (typically $50K-500K/year)

   Cost advantage: 30% cheaper due to smart model routing

8. KEY METRICS TO TRACK
   Win rate vs Intent ..................... Target: 60%
   Slop detection adoption ............... Target: 80%
   Approval gating enterprise adoption ... Target: 70%
   Cost savings achieved ................. Target: 30%
   BYOA adoption (post-Q3) ............... Target: 20% in 3 months

9. SUCCESS CRITERIA (12 Months)
   ARR: $10M (implies ~100 customers at $100K average)
   Enterprise revenue: 60% of ARR
   Win rate: 60% vs Intent
   CAC payback: <12 months
   NRR: >110%

10. NEXT ACTIONS (THIS WEEK)
    Sales: Read COMPETITIVE-STRATEGY.md
    Sales: Memorize 5 use cases + objection handlers
    Product: Confirm Q3 BYOA/Living Spec timeline
    Marketing: Start approval gating whitepaper
    Leadership: Review executive summary

================================================================================
SALES CONVERSATION TEMPLATES
================================================================================

ENTERPRISE CONVERSATION (Approval Gating)
─────────────────────────────────────────
You: "Your auditors asked about approval chains, right?"
Them: "Yes, but GitHub's built-in system doesn't give us what we need."
You: "GitHub logs reviews but doesn't bind them to changes. GWI binds
      approvals cryptographically. Every approval is signed, hashed,
      timestamped, and immutable. Auditors see a forensic trail."
Them: "Can we use this for compliance?"
You: "Yes. SOC 2, HIPAA. We have customers in both. Let me show you
      the audit artifacts..." [Show run.json with signatures]
Close: "Let's pilot with your audit team. Show them the forensics.
        If they're convinced, you're golden."

STARTUP CONVERSATION (Slop Detection)
──────────────────────────────────────
You: "How many of your daily PRs are actually important?"
Them: "Maybe 60%. Rest are dependency updates, bot stuff."
You: "GWI flags the junk automatically. Whitespace changes, comment
      improvements with no logic delta, first-time contributors with
      suspicious history. We auto-close anything >75% slop."
Them: "You just delete PRs?"
You: "Only ones you flag as slop. But we show you first. One week pilot,
      you'll see exactly what we're catching. Usually obvious in day 1."
Close: "Let's run the pilot. No commitment. See the value yourself."

SCALE-UP CONVERSATION (Cost Routing)
─────────────────────────────────────
You: "What's your current AI review budget?"
Them: "About $8K/month. Growing every quarter."
You: "What model are you using?"
Them: "Claude Opus for everything."
You: "That's why. Opus is best but most expensive. 60% of your PRs
      are simple (Gemini Flash would do fine). 30% are medium (Claude
      Sonnet). 10% are hard (Opus needed). Smart routing saves 30%."
Them: "But doesn't cheaper mean worse?"
You: "Nope. Flash is 98% accurate for triage. You're overthinking most
      PRs with Opus when Flash would do fine. We tested."
Close: "Let me run a cost simulation. Show you current spend vs GWI
        spend. Then you decide."

AGENCY CONVERSATION (BYOA - Post-Q3)
──────────────────────────────────────
You: "How many clients have different PR workflows?"
Them: "All of them. Client A wants fast auto-merge. Client B wants
       strict approval. Client C wants custom checks first."
You: "We're launching BYOA next quarter. You build custom agents once,
      deploy for all clients. No more GitHub Actions per client."
Them: "Intent already has that."
You: "True. But you're getting a lot of bot spam too. GWI detects
      and auto-closes slop. Plus we save 30% on costs. After Q3,
      you get all three: BYOA + slop + cost."
Close: "We're shipping Q3. Give us a pilot with your largest client.
        Show the value before BYOA ships. Interested?"

================================================================================
CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS (What Must Happen)
================================================================================

1. Q3 ROADMAP EXECUTION IS ESSENTIAL
   If BYOA ships on time → Win rate jumps from 40% to 70% in agencies
   If Living Spec ships on time → We match Intent's flexibility story
   If both ship → We're objectively better (moats + flexibility + cost)

   Cost of missing Q3: Lose 20%+ of deals, Intent takes momentum

2. SLOP DETECTION MUST VALIDATE IN MARKET
   Must prove: 85% accuracy + 20% review time savings
   If fails: Our main moat is weak, we're back to approval gating only
   Risk: Low (already live, data shows it works)

3. APPROVAL GATING MUST RESONATE WITH ENTERPRISE
   Must close: 3-5 enterprise deals citing approval gating
   If fails: Our biggest TAM (enterprise) goes to Intent
   Risk: Medium (enterprises are slow, but deal pipeline building)

4. COST STORY MUST DIFFERENTIATE
   Must prove: 30% cost savings in real customer deployments
   If fails: We're just another PR automation tool
   Risk: Low (multi-model routing proven in internal testing)

5. SALES TEAM MUST EXECUTE PLAYBOOK
   Must use: Battle cards, objection handlers, use case templates
   If fails: Competitive stories not reaching customers
   Risk: Medium (training + enablement required)

6. MESSAGING MUST LAND IN MARKET
   Must achieve: 60% of prospects aware of "approval gating" story
   If fails: We're seen as "just like Intent but cheaper"
   Risk: Medium (marketing/content execution)

================================================================================
RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS (What We Need)
================================================================================

SALES
├─ Training: 4 hours (use case + battle cards)
├─ Messaging: Updated collateral (approval gating whitepaper)
└─ Tools: Updated battlecards, CRM fields for win/loss analysis

PRODUCT/ENGINEERING
├─ Q3 Roadmap: BYOA (2 sprints) + Living Spec (3 sprints)
├─ Metrics: ARV gates for BYOA readiness
└─ Testing: Golden tests for BYOA correctness

├─ Messaging: Positioning deck, customer case studies
└─ Channels: Webinars, blog posts, analyst outreach

CUSTOMER SUCCESS
├─ Strategy: Deepen approval gating story with enterprises
├─ Training: Help enterprises set up approval workflows
└─ Reference Calls: Use enterprise customers in sales conversations

FINANCE
├─ Pricing: Validate $500/mo Pro tier, $50K-500K enterprise tier
└─ Metrics: Track CAC, LTV, payback period by segment

================================================================================
THE BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

GIT WITH INTENT IS THE SAFER CHOICE.

Intent is more flexible. We are safer, cheaper, and smarter about quality.

For enterprise teams that can't afford mistakes → GWI (approval gating)
For startups that can't afford costs → GWI (slop + routing)
For agencies that need flexibility → Intent (now) → GWI (after Q3)

After Q3, we're better on every dimension.

Our job: Ship Q3 on time, communicate moats clearly, close enterprise deals
         with approval gating, establish cost leadership with startups.
