# Budget Monitoring Configuration Example
#
# This file shows how to configure budget monitoring for your organization.
# Copy these settings to your repository variables or workflow inputs.

# ==============================================================================
# Repository Variables (Recommended)
# ==============================================================================
# Set these in your GitHub repository settings:
# Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables

# Monthly budget threshold in USD
BUDGET_THRESHOLD_USD: "100"

# Warning threshold (percentage of budget)
# Alert when spending exceeds this percentage
WARNING_THRESHOLD_PERCENT: "80"

# Critical threshold (percentage of budget)
# Create high-priority alert when spending exceeds this percentage
CRITICAL_THRESHOLD_PERCENT: "95"

# ==============================================================================
# Manual Workflow Trigger
# ==============================================================================
# You can override the budget threshold when manually triggering the workflow:
#
# Via GitHub CLI:
#   gh workflow run auto-fix-budget.yml --field budget_threshold=200
#
# Via GitHub UI:
#   Actions > Auto-Fix Budget Monitoring > Run workflow > Enter budget

# ==============================================================================
# Common Budget Configurations
# ==============================================================================

# Startup / Small Team ($100/month)
# - Good for: Small teams, side projects, early development
# - Supports: ~1000-2000 auto-fix runs/month (depending on complexity)
# BUDGET_THRESHOLD_USD: "100"
# WARNING_THRESHOLD_PERCENT: "80"
# CRITICAL_THRESHOLD_PERCENT: "95"

# Growing Team ($500/month)
# - Good for: Active development teams, multiple repositories
# - Supports: ~5000-10000 auto-fix runs/month
# BUDGET_THRESHOLD_USD: "500"
# WARNING_THRESHOLD_PERCENT: "75"
# CRITICAL_THRESHOLD_PERCENT: "90"

# Enterprise ($2000/month)
# - Good for: Large organizations, high-volume usage
# - Supports: ~20000-40000 auto-fix runs/month
# BUDGET_THRESHOLD_USD: "2000"
# WARNING_THRESHOLD_PERCENT: "70"
# CRITICAL_THRESHOLD_PERCENT: "85"

# ==============================================================================
# Alert Priorities
# ==============================================================================
# Issues are created with priority labels based on status:
#
# - p2 (warning): 80-95% of budget used
#   Action: Monitor closely, review high-cost repositories
#
# - p1 (critical): 95-100% of budget used
#   Action: Immediate review required, optimize spending
#
# - p0 (exceeded): >100% of budget used
#   Action: Budget exceeded, reduce usage or increase budget

# ==============================================================================
# Cost Optimization Tips
# ==============================================================================
#
# 1. Use Gemini Flash for simpler tasks
#    - Triage agent: Already uses Gemini Flash
#    - Consider for code review and basic analysis
#
# 2. Adjust complexity thresholds
#    - Higher thresholds = fewer auto-fix runs
#    - Target high-impact PRs only
#
# 3. Repository-level controls
#    - Disable auto-fix on low-priority repositories
#    - Use manual approval for expensive operations
#
# 4. Monitor provider costs
#    - Anthropic (Claude): Most expensive, best quality
#    - Google (Gemini): Cost-effective, good for simple tasks
#    - Balance provider usage based on complexity
#
# 5. Batch operations
#    - Group related fixes together
#    - Reduce redundant API calls
